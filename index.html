              <p>The Boston desegregation and busing crisis has found its place in the history books. The real lives of people within this movement make up the events, outbursts, emotional pleas, and frustrations on television, in the news, and in everyday lives. These emotions, fears, hopes, and plans are sometimes lost in the objectiveness of history, and the viewpoint of the historian. But, what is lost can sometimes be found. The following narratives are a blend of real life fact (actual quotes, journal entries, TV interviews, public statements) and fiction (my own interpretation of their position and understanding of the questions that have been asked of us in this final project). It is pertinent for me to address that I am in no way able to fully reflect the thoughts and views of those I am representing in this project. Additionally, each perspective is that of a single individual, and by no means representative of the thoughts of every single person in that category. Finally, I do believe that it is incredibly important to bring their own voices to the forefront, but do not want to conflate fantasy with reality. With all of that in mind, please enjoy “The Voices of Busing”.</p>

            <strong>An excerpt from the diary of W. Arthur Garrity, June 1974</strong>
            <br></br>

            <div class="sig">
            <p>My initials drawn from a small brown envelope in March 1972 determined my fate for what I believe will be the rest of my life. The court’s lottery system chose me to preside over the class-action lawsuit of Morgan v. Hennigan. This case has been one of the most difficult, tedious, vexing, controversial, and important matters heard in the history of the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts. I’ve worked tirelessly in my chambers and in my Wellesley study where I pen this journal entry today. I have read through countless school committee minutes, reviewed demographics, housing data, and neighborhoods changes. Now, at last, I was able to issue my 152-page decision on behalf of the plaintiffs.</p>
            <p>Through careful research and consideration, I concluded that the Boston School Committee took many actions in their official capacities with the purpose and intent to segregate the Boston Public Schools and that such actions cause current conditions of segregation within the Boston Public Schools. Because of this intentional and maintained racial segregation, I am charging school authorities with the duty to take whatever steps might be necessary.</p>
            <p>To correct the wrongs of segregated schooling, and to prevent future racial imbalance, my solution is to enforce busing. Busing, the pairing of schools, redistricting with both contiguous and non-contiguous boundary lines, involuntary student and faculty assignments, and all other means, some of which may be distasteful to both school officials and teachers and parents, must be evaluated; and, if necessary to achieve a unitary school system, they must be implemented. Next fall, 18,000 students will be ordered to take buses, including busing between Southie and Roxbury. This plan, originally developed by the Massachusetts State Board of Education, is in accordance with the state’s Racial Imbalance Law.</p>
            <p>I am authoring this educational initiative because there is no other choice. I understand that I will be faced with immense opposition from both White and Black stakeholders. There will be some upheaval within the city. Unfortunately, there is no one who can guarantee that no harm to the children will take place if they comply with the orders of the state and federal courts directing that school desegregation begin in a few months. On the other hand, the school committee and superintendent and other municipal and state officials appear to be taking every lawful precaution to reduce the risk of such harm, and various business and civic groups are endeavoring to create an atmosphere of community cooperation and goodwill for the purpose of minimizing it.</p>
            <p>Time will not change the minds of the fiercest critics, but it will bring along an understanding of the pertinence of desegregation in this city. It is only lawful and just to comply with the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of the United States, and I am not brave nor pioneering to do so. I am simply doing my duty.</p>
            <p>I see a long road ahead of me with this intervention and I pray to God that I have the guts to see this through. Segregation and racial imbalance in the Boston Public schools will be diminished by busing because the law requires it.</p>

              <br></br>

            <p>Restore Our Alienated Rights was an anti-desegregation and anti-busing organization formed by Louise Day Hicks. ROAR activists were constantly leading marches, public prayers, sit-ins, protests, and mock funerals. White families and students who were boycotting school were key members of ROAR. The following is a partial fact/partial fiction rendition of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way”. A real song utilized during the busing crisis to garner support for anti-busing. </p>
            <strong>R.O.A.R’s Way</strong>
            <div><i>(To the tune of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way”)</i></div>
            <br></br>
            <div>Verse 1</div>
            <div>And now, I have to say, it’s time to make a resolution.</div>
            <div>To do what we have to do to save our kids from this confusion.</div>
            <div>We’ll fight for what is right and may I say not in a shy way.</div>
            <div>Tonight, let us unite and do it R.O.A.R’s way.</div>
            <br></br>
            <div>Verse 2</div>
            <div>Our kids, by now you know, that they won’t go, cuz we won’t send them.</div>
            <div>The time is getting near for a constitutional amendment.</div>
            <div>The bus will never work, but some big jerk made a decision.</div>
            <div>This man, I really think, he didn’t listen.</div>
            <div>Yes, there’s a man, you know his name,</div>
            <div> and it’s a shame that he’s to blame.</div>
            <div>You know it’s clear to you and me,</div>
            <div>you see his name is Garrity.</div>
            <div>You know darn well he can go to hell.</div>
            <div>We’ll do it R.O.A.R’s way.</div>
            <br></br>
            <div>Verse 3</div>
            <div>Regrets, we’ve had a few.</div>
            <div>But then again, too few to mention.</div>
            <div>We did what we had to do and tried to end</div>
            <div>this intervention.</div>
            <div>Our schools, our Southie pride, “Protect” we’ve cried,</div>
            <div>Along the highway.</div>
            <div>And more, much more than that, we did it our way.</div>
            <br></br>
            <div>Verse 4</div>
            <div>Our seniors, are so confused, between Mayor White, and all the news.</div>
            <div>While Garrity, this crazy fool</div>
            <div>bit off more than he could chew.</div>
            <div>And through it all, tried to start small.</div>
            <div>To integrate Southie, once and for all.</div>
            <div>But we stood tall, and faced it all, and did it</div>
            <div>R.O.A.R’s way.</div>
            <br></br>
            <div>Verse 5</div>
            <div>For what is a White, what has he got?</div>
            <div>If not a school, then he has naught</div>
            <div>To uphold the education</div>
            <div>System as it already is</div>
            <div>The record shows </div>
            <div>we dealt some blows</div>

              <div>September 23, 1975</div>
            </strong>

            <p>So often we hear about schools, teachers, and administrators engaging in “Diversity Trainings” and culturally competent professional development seminars, but how does this really manifest in the classroom? I was curious to find out. With a little bit of persuasiveness and a lot of Midwestern kindness, I was able to get a sample of 9 teachers from an elementary school in Grand Rapids, Michigan. For the privacy of the respondents and the school district I won’t be using any real names. </p>
            <p>There are about 400 students that attend the school. It is 74% White, 8.5% Asian, 8% African American, 4% Hispanic, .3% American Indian (1 student), and 4.8% two or more races. 14% of students are low-income. The teaching staff is almost 100% White Females, with the exception of the principal - a Pacific Islander Male. </p>
            <p>I asked the participants, through an emailed interview, a series of questions to get them thinking about their positions as teachers, their own identities, and the identities of their students. I wanted to get an understanding of how they self-identify and how their background experiences did or did not affect their teaching. Additionally, I crafted questions that attempted to provide insight into how these teachers took on the issue of difference, with the overarching notion of race in mind. I devised these questions through reflection on my own learning during my time as an Educational Studies major. Behavior, discipline, literature, and “cultural competency” stuck out as major discrepancies in school settings when it came to the treatment of students of Color versus White students, and I sought to create a picture of the way real-life education professionals are making an impact. </p>
            <p>I chose to present my findings in a visualization for a few reasons: it is accessible through a URL to anyone and allows the user to make their own observations about the data through interaction. I also wanted to experience a different style of learning and expression, and coding has been a language that’s intrigued me for a while now. I am, by no means, a Computer Science major. So, I have my smart and amazing sidekick, Joe Campbell, to credit for the hours of coding that took place to create my visualization. I am also incredibly grateful to my mom for rounding up her colleagues and always being so supportive of my endeavors in Education. </p>
            <p>Without further ado, let’s begin!!</p>

            <strong>A Rallying Cry to Black Mothers to Continue Fighting for Equal Education, August 1975</strong>
            <br><br>
            <p>We have all seen the conditions in which our students had gone to school before desegregation. Now we are seeing the conditions in which are students are going to school after desegregation. We were outraged by the injustices then, and we are outraged by the injustices now. I told you all back then that the injustices present in our school system hurt our pride, robbed us of our dignity, and produced results which were injurious not only to our future but to those of the city, state, and nation. </p>
            <p>Do you remember what we’d see when we’d go to White schools? We’d see lovely classrooms with a small number of children in each class. The teachers were permanent. We’d see wonderful materials. That’s where the books went. That’s where the money went.</p>
            <p>Do you remember what we’d see in our schools? Overcrowded classrooms. Children sitting out in the corridors. Where there was a majority of Black students there was not concern for the way they learned. <p>
            <p>We have seen these conditions. We have felt these injustices. The racism that has dug its way to the deep roots of our country and our education system will not easily disappear. So, when we heard some of the remedies to the segregation in our schools, we were sunk. Do you remember how deflated we felt? Those of us who had lived in Boston all of our lives knew that this was going to be a very difficult thing to pull off. </p>
            <p>But, when we fight for education, we are fighting for our lives. We’re fighting for what the education will give us. We’re fighting for a job. We’re fighting to eat, we’re fighting to pay our medical bills. So, this is a total fight for us. We cannot do it all in one day.</p>
            <p>Now, sometimes I think, “Ruth, maybe you shouldn’t have gotten involved, maybe you shouldn’t have encouraged desegregation, to put our students through this is unbearable.” I’ve ridden the buses with our kids, I’ve seen what goes on, heard what those White parents and students are screaming.  But we cannot forget our fight. These brave students are fighting for the next generation, and the generation after that, to get a better education than they ever had.  We cannot keep allowing White folks to tell us that our kids are stupid. We cannot keep allowing these interventions to dismiss the root of the issue, that integration is more than having black students sit next to whites. We cannot let people, like Mrs. Hicks, keep making cruel statements and abusing her power. She questions us, “Do they think that sitting a White child beside a Black child, by osmosis the Black child will get better?" We don’t need for our children to “get better”. We need our children to experience equity. </p>
            <p>We need this desegregation movement to address the bare bones of this issue, the entrenched racism that has plagued all aspects of the lives of Black folks in Boston. From housing discrimination, lower job attainment, horizontal inequalities, de jure and de facto segregation,  and unequal and inequitable educational opportunities, we have faced oppressive systems for generations. Mayor White, nor Judge Garrity, nor Mrs. Hicks can speak on such oppression. I never heard any public official say that this was a good thing, that we should all live and learn together. Official neglect is what I call it.</p>
            <p>Rather, we must raise our own voices and continue to work for our sons and daughters. We must encourage them to love and not to hate. We must encourage them to rise above. I grew up here in Boston and I’ve been witnessing and living in these disparities my whole life. I hope that you all will stand with me to continue this journey towards equality, because the next generation depends shouldn’t have to face these disparities any longer. </p>

            <div class="left">Dear Judge Garrity:</div>
            <br></br>
            <p>Today I once again implore you to take decisive action to alleviate the rapidly deteriorating situation throughout the Boston Public School system. In particular, the parents of children attending South Boston High School have become increasingly alarmed and the pupils themselves are now angered and incensed. It is apparent that your initiatives to create opportunities for peaceful resolution of the so-called “racially imbalanced” schools have failed. As I have stated before, we here in Boston do not believe the premise that predominantly negro schools are inferior. The schools are fine the way they were. Furthermore, the superintendent of schools has stated that a racially imbalanced school is not educationally harmful. Because the situation has deteriorated and that civil disobedience is practiced widely (rather than your hope of children learning in peaceful harmony due to the busing intervention), I respectfully request that you join with me and other responsible community leaders to put an end to this shameful tragedy.</p>
            <p>We must now face the facts that forced busing to achieve desegregation is not acceptable and that municipal and state officials have not been able to take those precautions necessary to reduce the risk of harm to school children. Police stationed within the schools have been unable to maintain order and insure a climate conducive to learning. It is evident that only a diminishing number of individuals remain convinced that the implementation of the desegregation plan can be accomplished without city-wide chaos and disorder. The violence that has been inflicted upon children – both in and outside of our schools – and the animosity shown toward the police, have created such an air of tension and hatred that only decisive action can remedy the situation and restore peace and order to our community. </p>
            <p>If you want to build peace after this busing intervention, you must implement a different approach. I urge you as a leader of this undaunted group to share your vision with the parents of this city so as to allay their fears, frustrations, and forebodings. Let me suggest that this untried alternative could provide the communication necessary to restore order and tranquility to our beleaguered city. Without communication, we see no hope for peacebuilding during this horrific conflict. I’ve heard you claim on television that “time won’t change people’s minds, but will bring about an understanding for the most part that there is no alternative but to comply with the principles set out by the Supreme Court of the United States,” and you may be right. But we will not go down without a fight. </p>
            <p>Continued busing will not bring peace to this conflict. Let us move resolutely on this issue before this volatile situation deteriorates to the point of unbridled anarchy.</p>

            <div>Writing poems is a waste of my time.</div>

            <div>When this year is over I’ll be glad.</div>
            <div>This integration stuff makes me mad.</div>
            <div>Success of busing will make things great they say.</div>

            <div>Rough conditions did shake the darling buds of me.</div>
            <div>And teacher’s lease hath all too short a date:</div>
            <div>Sometimes too hot the temperature of rooms,</div>
            <div>And often is our idea of complexion dimm’d;</div>
            <div>And every terror from there sometime declines,</div>
            <div>By chance or nature’s changing course of bus;</div>

            <p>Good evening.</p>
            <p>In 1954 the U.S. Supreme Court decided that segregated school systems were forbidden by the 14th Amendment.<p>
            <p>Twenty years later, in 1974, the Federal Court found that the Boston School Committee had by official action created and maintained a segregated school system. Boston, like many other cities, was ordered to obey the Constitution by integrating the public schools.</p>
            <p>The Constitutional principle was clear. But following it has not been easy. A series of complex plans has required children to be bused out of their neighborhoods. The local Federal Court has felt it necessary to become deeply involved in the details of school management. There has been widespread, sometimes violent, resistance to these court orders. In fact, a few of our schools have virtually become armed camps, their playgrounds and corridors patrolled by guards and police. Every city taxpayer has been burdened with the large cost of carrying out the mandate of court and Constitution.</p>
            <p>During this time, I myself have disagreed with some aspects of what has become a continuous judicial supervision of the public schools. But I have never quarreled with the basic principle of the 14th Amendment or with the authority of the Federal Government.  I have pursued my disagreements by appeal through the judicial system. A few weeks ago, the Supreme Court resolved these disputes; it rejected all the city’s appeals and it upheld the order of the court.</p>
            <p>Certain things are now clear.</p>
            <p>First, the process of desegregation will continue. Schools that are now integrated will remain integrated. Where segregation remains, it will be eliminated.</p>
            <p>Second, for some indefinite period of time, busing will continue. That is the order of the Supreme Court and it will be enforced.</p>
            <p>I understand and I share the general discontent in this city with compulsory busing. No parents, black or white, enjoy seeing their children transported to remote neighborhoods. It is my hope that busing can be carefully limited to that which is necessary; and that in some happier time it will be replaced by a more natural integration, based on full social and economic equality.</p>
            <p>One thing that I know for sure is that Boston has gotten out of control. I have had to declare curfews and ban crowds outside of schools. The court has ruled that busing is the law in Boston and this city is under a federal court order. Although the Boston police cannot implement this law alone, I intend to protect children and continue to impose order through a heightened police presence. As Mayor, I am responsible at a minimum for public safety, and a maximum for the social health of all Bostonians. By responding politically, it is my duty to tell this city the truth. And the truth is that busing will continue.</p>
            <p>However, while busing paralyzes us, a backlog of other problems grows. 1) the pain and destruction of unemployment, 2) the desperate plight of our elderly, 3) the corrosive effect of crime, and 4) the crushing burden of our tax system. These are challenges that remain in our city, that remain avoided because of the uproar of the busing crisis. Unless we respond to these problems also, our racial conflicts will be with us long after busing had faded from memory. In fact, the enormity of those problems helps explain why our racial problems have become so severe, so turbulent and so resistant to rational solution.</p>
            <p>For the past two years I have tried to hold this city together. The time has now come, once again, to move it forward. So, in response to my judgement of this City’s needs now, and in conjunction with the recent recommendations made to me by the Mayor’s Committee on Violence, this City will over the coming months: take initial steps to determine the conditions under which expanding the Boston School Committee would be feasible, to have a Black representative provide voice for their children, fight to end the receivership of South Boston High, create a panel of outstanding educators to re-evaluate the school administration leadership, convene the presidents of universities in Boston and demand they set aside a substantially increased number of scholarships for Boston high school graduates, meet with leaders of business and request them to establish a special apprenticeship program for neighborhood children, and  expand police personnel.</p>
            <p>I will do the best I can. But I also know that the choice will not, finally, be made in City Hall. The decision will come from the streets and the clubhouses, the homes and parks, in every block, of every neighborhood, of this city.</p>
            <p>The choice of what future we have is yours. Only you can make it, and I honestly hope your choice will be right with God and this city.</p>
            <p>Thank you.<p>
